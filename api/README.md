# APIs

## Project

Build a quick-and-dirty data analysis using both public API data and raw web data. The base file uses Giantbomb.com video game prices and FRED STL USD inflation prices to contextualize them. 

**Note: The base project file's implementation of inflation calculation isn't really accurate (per the instructions) but I'm fixing that.**
